The Game Engine takes handles all entities and other objects that are part of the game
  - The Game Engine will have a set game tick (30fps) and will call render and act for all entities in the game
  - The Game Engine will also handle scene transitions and have a current scene state
  - The Game Engine will call '.run()' on each scene every game tick
  - The Game Engine will subscribe to mousemove and use that to keep track of the mouse/cursor
  - The Game Engine will subscribe to keypress and use that to keep track of what keys are being pressed
  - The Game Engine will pass mouse and key events on to each scene to handle

Scenes handle and represent different game states
  - Scenes will contain entities and handle game logic for specific scenarios/game states

Entities are things that are drawn to the screen and interact in some way with other entities, they can be thought of as game objects/actors
  Units are entities that have health/other attributes as well as being entities
    Players move around the screen and shoot projectiles at monsters
    Monsters move around the screen and harm the player upon contact
      Amblers are dumb as rocks and move in a straight line, bouncing off other monsters
      Walkers walk slowly towards the player
      Sprinters sprint quickly towards the player, and have a set turning radius
      Jumpers walk towards the player, and dash/jump at them when close enough
      Cloakers are like walkers, but are invisible except for a periodic shimmer. They decloak when close enough
      Shooters try to keep their distance from the player and shoot at them
  Projectiles are entities that are created by units and persist until collision with another entity
    Bullets move in a straight line and damage things they collide with, ceasing to exist after impact
    Rockets move in a straight line and explode upon contact deal Area of Effect/Splash damage
    Stream projectiles move in a line to a set distance, with some spread, and go through enemies, dealing damage to them
